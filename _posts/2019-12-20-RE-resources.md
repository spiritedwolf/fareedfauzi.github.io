## Introduction

Reverse code engineering is it’s an ART of dissecting and rebuild. Understand the inner working of program and its mechanism.

Good guy (hopefully we are) use RCE to :-
1. Recovery own lost source code
2. Recovery of data from legacy formats
3. Malware analysis and research
4. Security and Vulnerability research

Bad guy use RCE to :-
1. Reverse engineering competing product and sell it
2. Crack copy protections
3. Distribute crack / registration for copyrighted software
4. Gained unauthorized access to any computer

Required skills and knowledge :-

 1. Basic computer architecture
 2. Operating System
 3. Native OS API, Operating Systems Internals (e.g. Windows Internals)
 4. C/C++ programming
 5. Assembly language programming
 6. Executable file format (e.g. Portable Executable (PE))
 7. Scripting (Python, Javascript, VB Script)
 8. Logic thinking and Research skills
